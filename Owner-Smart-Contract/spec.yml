  The task is to create an ownership smart contract.
  In this smart contract, there will be one entity i.e. the owner of the smart contract.
  The person who will deploy the smart contract will become the owner of the smart contract.
  The owner can change the ownership of the smart contract.
  Whenever the owner of the smart contract is changed. An event will be emitted emitting the old owner's address and the new owner's address.
  And anyone can access the smart contract to see the owner of the smart contract.
